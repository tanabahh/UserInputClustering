# UserInputClustering

This program will help you cluster various surveys and product reviews. Now you do not need to analyze a huge number of reviews and find useful ones for you. The program will do everything for you.

The input is a dataset of comments. At the output, we get a set of clusters, information about the number of reviews in each cluster, as well as its name.
